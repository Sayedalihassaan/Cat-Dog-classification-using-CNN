# Cat Dog Classification with Convolutional Neural Network

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a project that classifies images of cats and dogs using a convolutional neural network (CNN).

## Project Structure

data/: Contains the image data for training and testing.
train/: Contains the training images, organized into cat and dog subfolders.
test/: Contains the testing images (optional).
models/: Contains the trained model file(s).
code/: Contains Python scripts for model building, training, and evaluation.
train.py: Script for training the CNN model.
predict.py: Script for making predictions on new images.
README.md: This file (provides project overview and instructions).
## Dependencies

Python 3.x
TensorFlow or Keras
NumPy
OpenCV (for image loading and processing)
Other libraries as needed
